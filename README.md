##What is Docker?
Docker creates portable lightweight containers for software applications that can be run on any machine with Docker installed, regardless of the OS running on the machine.
##Basic Concepts
Docker Container : Directories containing everything-your-application.
Docker Images    : Snapshots of containers or base OS (e.g. Ubuntu) images.
Linux Containers : Combination various kernel-level features which allow    
                   management of applications contained within their own environment.
##How is it different from VMs?
###VMs
A virtual machine emulates a physical computing environment, but requests for CPU, memory, hard disk, network and other hardware resources are managed by a virtualization layer which translates these requests to the underlying physical hardware.
###Docker
Docker uses Linux Containers,which are operating system-level capabilities that make it possible to run multiple isolated Linux containers, on one control host. Linux Containers serve as a lightweight alternative to VMs as they donâ€™t require the hypervisors
